# Bernouilli distribution
* Calculation of the [Expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
  * It is the same than the traditional mean ($\frac{1}{N} \times \Sigma x_i$)
  * when all $x_i$ have the same probability to arise namely $\frac{1}{N}$
## [Accompanying GitHub chap2](https://github.com/vagmcs/PRML/blob/add0f728e4fdfc9e2296faea173c75ab3e294a2f/notebooks/ch2_probability_distributions.ipynb)
* there is a good demo of the Bernouilli mean and variance on [one of the accompnying GitHub](https://github.com/vagmcs/PRML/blob/add0f728e4fdfc9e2296faea173c75ab3e294a2f/notebooks/ch2_probability_distributions.ipynb)
* The IN[3] is special it draws from the normal and the Modified coins
  * it gives the $\mu^{x_i}$ 
  * * the $\mu$ itself is given by the *np.arange(start, end, step)*
* We have the calculation that calculate the largest log likehood ! $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\log p(D|\mu)$
# p 70 Binomial distribution
* Equation 2.10 comes from equation 2.5, it represents only one possibility
* the number of ways getting m out of N (unordered) is explained also in the [accompanying website](https://github.com/vagmcs/PRML/blob/add0f728e4fdfc9e2296faea173c75ab3e294a2f/notebooks/ch2_probability_distributions.ipynb). it is noted $\binom{N}{m} = \frac{N!}{(N-m)!m!}$ 
* in this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Expected_value_and_variance) there is a simple calculation of the Esperance and the Variance.
  * Exercise 1.10 shown it this [1.2 Probability Theory](https://github.com/vagmcs/PRML/blob/add0f728e4fdfc9e2296faea173c75ab3e294a2f/notebooks/ch1_introduction.ipynb) (We should substract $P(A \cap B)$ only once) shows that the probability of two independent variables is the sum of probabilities
  * For the variance of two independant variable see that [very clear Blog](https://statproofbook.github.io/P/var-sum.html)
  * The pure calculus method is shown p 127 (Exercises 2.2 + 2.3 + 2.4)
### The pure caculus method (p 127-128)
* Equation 2.262 has been solved on my parperboard
* Equation 2.263 we start with $(1+x)^2$ and demonstrate why if it is true for $(1+x)^N$ it should be true for $(1+x)^{N+1}$
  * by using equation 2.262 ([this blog](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-does-zero-factorial-equal-one-3126598)  explains why $0!$ equals 1)
  * also on my paper board ($\binom{N}{0}$ and $\binom{N}{N}$ all equal to 1)
