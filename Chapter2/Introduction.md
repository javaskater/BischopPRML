# parametric distribution
* The Gaussian distribution is a parametric distribution because governed 
  * by the use of two parameters, namely the mean $\mu$ and the variance $\sigma$
* Bayes: from prior distribution to posterior distribution given the observed data !
* non paremtric models: the parameters control more the complexity than the form of the distribution
