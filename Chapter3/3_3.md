* Equation 3.10 p 141
# 153:
* The job had been done in 2.116 (page 93)
  * Exercise 3.7 (page 175) tells us to use the [technique of completing the square](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/completing-square.html)
  * Equantion 3.10 is on page 141
## **TODO (Needs to be understood)** p(t) is calculated as equation 2.115 (p 93)
  * Here W is x and t is y
  * $m_0$ is $\mu$ and $S_0$ is $\Lambda^{-1}$
* for the focrmula 2.115 [9 years ago someone asked for explaination](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/177488/proof-of-the-derivation-of-the-marginal-and-conditional-gaussian)

* the 3.10 equation is about the product of variables we are generalazing the prior to be the product of priors 
  * the first term is the product of first terms
  * the second term the exponetial; the product of exponentials is the exponential of the sum...
* for the equations 3.58 and 3.59 are calculated with equation 2.115 (p 93) see *TODO to be understood* above
