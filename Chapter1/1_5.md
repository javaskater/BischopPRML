* $p(x|C_1)$ is the fraction of points in class $C_1$
# 46
* $p(C_k)$: proportion of data points in each class
## Equation 1.88
* see Appendix D page 703
* 1.88 comes from the [derivative of compound function](https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/derivatives-of-composite-functions/)
  * try a $\frac{\partial E_L}{\partial x}$ and withdraw the $y'(x)$
* but I have a clearer response int the [calculus of variations on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations)
  * or see page 703 (which is appendix D)
### Appendix D (p 704)
* the sum of variables $x_i$ (i $\in$ 1..D) is replaced by the $\int_x\times dx$
# 48 
* [multimodal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_distribution)
  * many max
  * see plot 1.29 p 49
