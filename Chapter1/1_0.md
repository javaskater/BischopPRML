# p 2
* the t vector can be the expected digit but one hot encoded
 * y can be the probaibilities in the onhot output (a probaiblity for each position in the output)
   * y encoded the same way as the target vector !
* generalization: the art of correctly categorize new examples 
* feature extraction: here the process of reducing all the entry images to the same dimension !
* feature extraction: in the case of pattern recognition I don't want to give the entire video as an input !
# p 3
* Classification is a kind of supervides learning (discrete outputs) ... such as regression (continuous output)
* clustering belongs to _unsupervised learning_ (find groups of similar data withing the examples)
